# Rusty To-Do List

Rusty To-Do List is a small command-line interface (CLI) project written in Rust. It serves as an introductory project for learning the fundamentals of the Rust programming language.


## Motivation

This project is my first try into Rust programming. I created it with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of Rust's syntax, concepts, and best practices. I aim to learn some core concepts with a low level language in order to better understand high-level languages like Python or Javascript.

By building a simple to-do list application, I have explored various aspects of Rust development, including error handling, data structures, and command-line interfaces.


## Deployment

If you wish to install this small project on your local machine, follow these steps:

_Note: you need to have Rust and cargo installed on your machine. These steps will work under Linux, MacOS and Windows._

  cd rusty_todo
  cargo build --release
```

Linux / MacOS users:
